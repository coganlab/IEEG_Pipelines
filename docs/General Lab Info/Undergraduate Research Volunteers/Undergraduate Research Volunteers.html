<h2>Process for Adding Duke Undergraduate Students to Study Personnel</h2>
<ol><li>All Duke undergraduates on research teams must be adults (18 years or older). The process below should be followed for Duke undergraduates who are unpaid volunteers, regardless of whether they are receiving academic credit. Duke undergraduates who are hired as research personnel and are Duke employees may be added as key personnel after meeting the standard requirements for key personnel, however, should their employment status change, they&nbsp; must be updated in iRIS.</li>
<li>All Duke undergraduates must complete the same <a href="https://medschool.duke.edu/research/clinical-and-translational-research/duke-office-clinical-research/docr-services-and-initiativesprojects/training-and-communications/citi-training">CITI modules</a>&nbsp;as all other Duke Health Researchers. Be sure to affiliate with Duke Health on the CITI website. Please upload the CITI completion report, documenting completion of required modules in the iRIS amendment.</li>
<li>One of two agreement letters must be completed by the study team and signed by the Duke undergraduate and the Office of Research Contracts (email&nbsp;faye.murrell@duke.edu with the signed letter):</li>
<ol><li><a href="/w/file/135975390/Volunteer%20Letter%20Agreement%20Clinical%20Research.doc">Volunteer agreement letter</a>: intended for unpaid intern or volunteers, including Duke undergraduate students, who are NOT engaged in conducting the consent process&nbsp;</li>
<li>Agreement letter for Duke undergraduates engaged in the consent process is untended for only unpaid, undergraduate Duke students engaged in the consent process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
