<h2><strong>&nbsp;Initial Setup</strong></h2>
<ol><li>Approximately 48 hours after the operation, contact an ECoG tech to help install the research cables</li>
<li>Research cables:</li>
<ol><li>Trigger cable (photo diode): DC1 (request the gain to be 10 mV)</li>
<li>Audio cable: the next 2 available channels (we have reservations on Box 1)&nbsp;</li>
</ol><li>The gain for the trigger cable should be sensitive enough to be able to clearly see the triggers (10 mV is the ideal setting)</li>
<li>The gain for the audio cables should be the same as the other channels</li>
<li>Run playbeeps.m to test the triggers and verify you can clearly see the triggers on the screen (Zeus PC&gt;C:\Psychtoolbox_Scripts\playbeeps)&nbsp;</li>
<li>Note when the system restarts--you want to avoid running a task when the system reboots as this will cut out data. You can view the reset time in top header.</li>
</ol><p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Standard Data Collection</h2>
<ol><li>Unplug the bed from the wall and disable any alarms (you may need to get the help from the nurse)&nbsp;</li>
<li>Run a practice task in the lab to verify the task is functioning</li>
<li>In the audio manager verify the playback device is default to the FIO amplifier&nbsp;</li>
<li>Connect the photo diode to the BNC cable (peach colored) and plug that cable into DC1 input.</li>

<ol><li>Connect the audio cable with the BNC connector with the audio input.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The following diagram is the overall setup for traditional auditory tasks:</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol><li>The microphone amplifier should be setup as follows:</li>

<ol><li>Verbally explain the task to the participant (this is where scripts come in handy) and run a practice block with the participant&nbsp;</li>
<li>Give feedback to the participant to ensure the task is being correctly done (i.e. waiting for the Speak cue). Use positive encouragement when he/she does the practice correctly!</li>
<li>Make note of the time of recording for the start and end of blocks in the ECoG notebook</li>
<li>At the conclusion of the task, thank the participant and give him/her an estimate of when you will return for another task.</li>
<li>Remove all research equipment and store in the box.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ol><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Finished with overall data collection</h2>
<ol><li>Thank the participant for their involvement in the research study.</li>
<li>Ask an ECoG tech to remove the research audio cables from the box.&nbsp;</li>
