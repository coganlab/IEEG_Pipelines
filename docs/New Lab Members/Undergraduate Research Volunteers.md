# Process for Adding Duke Undergraduate Students to Study Personnel

1. All Duke undergraduates on research teams must be adults (18 years or older). The process below should be followed for Duke undergraduates who are unpaid volunteers, regardless of whether they are receiving academic credit. Duke undergraduates who are hired as research personnel and are Duke employees may be added as key personnel after meeting the standard requirements for key personnel, however, should their employment status change, they  must be updated in iRIS.
2. All Duke undergraduates must complete the same [CITI modules](https://medschool.duke.edu/research/clinical-and-translational-research/duke-office-clinical-research/docr-services-and-initiativesprojects/training-and-communications/citi-training) as all other Duke Health Researchers. Be sure to affiliate with Duke Health on the CITI website. Please upload the CITI completion report, documenting completion of required modules in the iRIS amendment.
3. One of two agreement letters must be completed by the study team and signed by the Duke undergraduate and the Office of Research Contracts (email faye.murrell@duke.edu with the signed letter):

   1. [Volunteer agreement letter](Volunteer%20Letter%20Agreement%20Clinical%20Research.doc): intended for unpaid intern or volunteers, including Duke undergraduate students, who are NOT engaged in conducting the consent process 
   2. Agreement letter for Duke undergraduates engaged in the consent process is untended for only unpaid, undergraduate Duke students engaged in the consent process.  

4. An email must be sent to your CRU medical directory (Dr. Peter Fecci at peter.fecci@duke.edu) or Oversight Organization director (or Dept. Chair if you are not part of a CRU) containing the following:

   1. Name of Duke undergraduate
   2. Pro# of study

   4. Specific description of the individual's role on the study (including whether the individual will be conducting the consent process and expected time on the study team
   5. Please ask the CRU medical director or Oversight Organization to respond with an approval via email 

5. A regular amendment must be submitted in iRIS to add the Duke undergraduate to external key personnel for each study on which he/she participates. The amendment must contain copies of:
