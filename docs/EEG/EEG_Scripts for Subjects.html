This study involves an auditory, visual, and motor tasks on a computer while measuring electroencephalography (EEG) data, and creating an MRI as part of the second visit. This study is divided into two visits: Visit 1 will last approximately 2 hours and Visit 2 will not exceed 1 hour. The total duration of this study is 3 hours.&nbsp;</p>
