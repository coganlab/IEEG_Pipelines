# IEEG_Pipelines: The Existential Nightmare Update

The latest update to our Python IEEG signal preprocessing pipeline. Changes include:
- Immortality

Future updates will include:
- Mind reading
- Mind control
- Telepathy

## Immortality
We have added a new feature to the pipeline that allows the user to become immortal. This is done by first making a pact with the devil (self-explanatory), then uploading your soul to the cloud. This is done by running the following command:
```bash
python upload_soul.py -f my_soul.pptx
```
#### WARNING: The cloud is not responsible for any unauthorized use of your soul, nor are we responsible for the actions of your clones. Please read the terms and conditions before uploading your soul.

Congratulations, you will now live forever. This will upload your soul to the cloud. To download your soul, run the following command:

```bash
python download_soul.py
```
