<p>Repeat: You will hear a series of words/non-words (funny sounding words that don't mean anything) and you are to repeat them.&nbsp; The first thing you will see on the screen is a cue that says 'Listen'.&nbsp; After that, you will hear either a word or a non-word.&nbsp; After a short delay, the screen will say 'Speak' and you are to repeat the word/non-word you heard.&nbsp; There are 2 blocks and they each take about 8 minutes.&nbsp; You can stop at any time, and please use the breaks between blocks if you want to.</p>

<p>Decision:&nbsp;You will hear a series of words/non-words (funny sounding words that don't mean anything) and you are to say 'yes' if it is a word and 'No' if it is not.&nbsp; The first thing you will see on the screen is a cue that says 'Listen'.&nbsp; After that, you will hear either a word or a non-word.&nbsp; After a short delay, the screen will say 'Speak' and you are to say if it is a word or not ('Yes' or 'No').&nbsp; There are 2 blocks and they each take about 8 minutes.&nbsp; You can stop at any time, and please use the breaks between blocks if you want to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will see a cue on the screen to either Repeat or Yes/No. You will then hear a word or non-word. When the screen shows 'Speak', repeat the word if the cue was 'Repeat' or decide if the word was a real word or non-word ny saying Yes or No if the cue was 'Yes/No'.</p>
