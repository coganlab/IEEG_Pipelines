<p>The word "Listen" will appear on the screen and then disappear. You will hear a series of words or non-words (funny sounding words that do not have an English meaning) in a list sequence. After a short quiet period the word "Probe" will appear on the screen and, you will hear one word or non-word. If the word/non-word played was part of the previous list sequence, press the YES key. If the word/non-word was not part of the previous list sequence, press the NO key. Respond as quickly as possible. There are 5 blocks total that take about 8 minutes each. You can stop at any time, and please use the breaks between blocks if you want to.&nbsp;</p>
