<h2>Preparation</h2>
<ol><li>This is done a few days prior to the data collection</li>
<li>Using the height and weight reported by the potential subject, determine what head cap size to use.&nbsp;</li>
<ol><li>54 head cap: &lt;5'4 (petite individuals)</li>
<li>56 head cap: 5'5-5'9 (average build)&nbsp;</li>
<li>58&nbsp; head cap: 5'10-6'0 (above average)</li>
<li>60 head cap: &gt;6'0 (tall individuals)&nbsp;</li>
<li>It's best to round down and have the head cap be more fitted to the subject's head rather than too loose&nbsp;</li>
</ol><li>It's best to assemble the head cap on the glass head&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Insert the electrodes into the head cap based on the number and holder color</li>
<ol><li>Green: 1-32</li>
<li>Yellow: 33-64</li>
<li>Red: 65-96</li>
<li>White: 97-128</li>
<li>Electrodes 125-128 will be placed on the face around the eyes&nbsp;</li>
<li>Blue: REF</li>
<li>Black: GND&nbsp;</li>
</ol><li>Wire management: organize the wires into bundles</li>
<ol><li>Wires should not cover the electrode surface</li>
<li>Avoid hanging wires in front of the eyes/face</li>
<li>Utilize the velcro ties to bundle the wire&nbsp;</li>
</ol><li>Check the electrode location positions via <a href="/w/page/123514134/CapTrak">CapTrak&nbsp;</a>. Do not save the test measurement once the check is complete.</li>
</ol><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Sign Consent</h2>
<ol><li>The clinical research coordinator will consent and enroll the subject into the study.</li>
<li>The subject should be given a copy of the consent form to keep for his/her records</li>
<li>The original copy should be kept in the research lab in a locked filing cabinet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ol><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Experimental Procedure</h2>
<p><strong>Questionnaires</strong></p>
<ol><li>Distributed via RedCap</li>
<li>Assign the participantID to the subject (E#)</li>
<li>Questionnaires: Phone Screen Survey and Handedness survey</li>
<li>Have the subject complete the questionnaires on the stimulus presentation PC while gelling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ol><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Head Cap Preparation</strong></p>
<ol><li>Ask the subject if he/she needs to use the restroom prior to data collection. You may have to remind them they will be sitting in the chair for about 2 hours.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Ask to remove any jackets or sweatshirts that require going over the head prior to putting on the head cap.</li>
<li>Measure the circumference and vertex of the subject (Vertex = naison to inion divided by 2)</li>
<li>Place the head cap on the subject's head and adjusting the head cap to the center of the head (vertex). Green 18 should be aligned with the vertex</li>
<li>Once the head cap is centered, secure the velcro chin strap and check with the subject for comfort.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ol><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Gelling</strong></p>
<ol><li>Gelling can be done simultaneously as the CapTrak measurement</li>
<li>Let the subject know the gel may feel cold and have a wet texture.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Eye electrodes (White 125-128)</li>
<ol><li>Use an alcohol wipe around the eyes to remove dirt, oils, and makeup from the subject's face</li>
<li>Place a double-sided adhesive disk on the electrode and a small amount of gel on the electrode.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Place electrodes on the left and right outer canthi&nbsp; and the lower canthi using the other side of double-sided adhesive disks&nbsp;</li>
</ol><li>It's best to start with a small amount of gel in each hole (approximately 'pea size' amount) and then add more gel as a second pass</li>
<li>Adding too much gel in the beginning may cause the gel to spread to neighboring sites and lead to bridging. Data is then recorded between the two sites rather than the scalp of the head.</li>
<li>One of the best techniques for administering gel is to use the tip of the syringe to make circular movements to part the hair and then dispense the gel. Clearly explain to the subject that you are shifting hair out of the way and it should not be painful.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>It's best to keep the syringe out of the subject's line of sight. Even though the syringes have a blunt tip, we do not know if the subject is weary of syringes or items that look like needles.</li>
</ol><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Checking Impedances</strong></p>
<ol><li>Plug the ribbon cables into the respective inputs on the Active Control Box.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Insert the batteries and power on.</li>
<li>Hold the "Z" button on the left hand side of the Active Control Box until the first set of electrodes (Green, Ch 1-32) LEDs are turned on.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Adjust individual electrodes to change to a green state.&nbsp;</li>
<ol><li>Primarily adjust red colored LEDS</li>
<li>Electrodes that alternate between yellow and green may need time for the gel to settle. It's okay to come back to these electrodes as a second pass, and over time the electrode could stabilize to green.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ol><li>Move onto the next set (Yellow, Ch 33-64), followed by Red (65-96) and White (97-128). Impedance checks will also occur for the eye electrodes.</li>
<li>Beeping from the Active Control Box is a warning that the impedance measurement will end soon for a particular section.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Once the impedance levels are at the appropriate level, press the "Z" button again to stop the impedance check.&nbsp;</li>
</ol><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Data Collection</strong></p>
<ol><li>On the data collection PC (password: SpeecH422) click on the BrainVision Recorder press the (insert icon) in the toolbar to view the neural signal</li>
<li>To start the recording press the green play button (insert icon)</li>
<li>Subject files should be saved as: SubjectID_Task_MMDDYY</li>
<li>Three files will be created for each saved data collection: VMRK, EEG, HDR</li>
<li>Run the experimental task. See the lists of tasks here.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
