        across time, but not channels, you would set ignore_adjacency = 1.

    This function computes the F-statistic for a sine wave in locally-white

    where :math:`A` is the amplitude of the sine wave, :math:`f` is the

    wave. The F-statistic is computed by taking the ratio of the variance of
    the sine wave to the variance of the noise. The variance of the sine wave
    is computed by taking the sum of the squares of the sine wave across tapers
